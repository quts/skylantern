#SkyLantern
##about the website
This is an website wrote in Ruby on Rails and others libraries, and it's still working at <http://skylantern.herokuapp.com/>.

##Why we establishied it
We wanted to design a pulk like social website. However, unlike plurk focus on sharing mood with friend immediately, SkyLantern try to establish a platform which sharing the things what will happen in the feature. In other words, we try to share "dream", and the joy of "dreams come ture".  

##Design concept
The design concept form chinese culture. During the period of three kingdoms in chinese history, legion contact with others via a big balloon which made by paper and drive by hot air.Now, in Pingxi, Taiwan, There's a lot of tourists write their dream or what they hope it will come true on the sky lantern, and fly it in to sky. For example, if I want to find take the London Eye, the ferris wheel located in london, and I share it by using SkyLantern. After this, my friends may offer me informations about travelling in London, or urge me to finish it.

##Feature
SkyLantern has a timeline in future, every new post has to set a target time and each sky lantern has different height means the distance between now and the target time. Therefore, if a sky lantern reached the top of the screen, it's means that the message should be done. Because of this, friends will know what you should done at this time.
